## ðŸŒŸUQCS 2025 Hackathon Best Newcomers WinnerðŸŒŸ
### TLDR; 

  A program to generate a Minecraft commands that builds custom Boolean logic circuits.

  See *"proof by minecraft.pdf"* by Matt to get a very in-depth explanation. It should be the very bottom file on this page.

-----
### Explanation:

This project is about creating a generator which makes a Minecraft world representing a First Order Logic expression with logic gates using minecraft redstone. The user will be able to set the input variables to true/false using levers, in order to gain a visual understanding of the expression. It will also have the ability to compare the LHS and RHS of an expression to evaluate whether it is true/false, and understand why it is as such.
