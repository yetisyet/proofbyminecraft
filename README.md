## UQCS 2025 Hackathon Best Newcomers Winner 

  A program that generates Minecraft commands to build redstone logic circuits.

-----
### Overview
The aim of this project was to create a fun, visual, and deterministic representation of boolean algebra in Minecraft.

**Proof by Minecraft** takes first order logic expressions from the user and computes a Minecraft command, which when used with a command block, will generate a Minecraft redstone circuit that represents the expression with logic gates. You can toggle the variables to see how their truth values affect the expression's outcome.
