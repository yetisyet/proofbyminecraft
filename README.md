TLDR; 

A program to generate a Minecraft word with custom logic expressions.

Made with Python 

-----

This project is about creating a generator which makes a Minecraft world representing a First Order Logic expression with logic gates using minecraft redstone. The user will be able to set the input variables to true/false using levers, in order to gain a visual understanding of the expression. It will also have the ability to compare the LHS and RHS of an expression to evaluate whether it is true/false, and understand why it is as such.
